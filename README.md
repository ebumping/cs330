How do I approach designing software?
To approach designing software you must first analyze and break down the requirements into problems that you can create solutions for.  Breaking down problems can allow complex issues to be handled step-by-step.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I have learned a lot about OpenGL and C++ and I have used them to create a 3D model with textures, complex lighting, and movement/view controls.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
Each problem was broken down to a single step.  Several times I ran into issues that the solution was to just start over again on a new iteration of the project. Later in the project I used extensive debugging to solve a memory isse.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
These are all good practices for developing modular and flexible programs.  Moving forward I will be using debugging a lot more now that I have a better understanding of it.

How do I approach developing programs?
By breaking down user/client requirements into more easily solvable problems.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Mostly I would run the program constantly.  The more frequently I tested the code, the better understanding I had of the scene as a whole.

How did iteration factor into your development?
My software went through many iterations and each one was more stable and functional than the last.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
At first I didn't have a great understanding of C++ fundamentals.  Throughout this course I became more accustomed to developing with textures, lighting and more complex shapes.  I had to rely on debugging to finish the scene which I had very little experience of in a C++ environment before.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer Science is a great passion and it has great meaning in both my personal and professional goals.  Computer Science can be difficult at times but is incredibly rewarding when you do it well.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Having experience with the wide array of concepts put forth in this course gives me more tools for creative implementations in future projects, as well as transferable skills such as debugging.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Many different fields use the knowledge and skills from this class.  Mobile applications use shaders frequently and debugging is absolutely crucial to every software project.
